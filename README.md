Open source platforms like OpenStreetMap allow us to zoom into a level of detail, revealing structures in the landscape, and add attributes to our analysis. 

There are Python packages like OSMnx that allow OpenStreetMap downloads into a Jupyter Notebook independent of a specific application or tool..
OSMnx is a Python package that lets you download spatial data from OpenStreetMap and model, project, visualize, and analyze real-world street networks. You can download and model walkable, drivable, or bikeable urban networks with a single line of Python code, and then easily analyze and visualize them. You can just as easily download and work with other infrastructure types, amenities/points of interest, building footprints, elevation data, street bearings/orientations, and speed/travel time.
